# annoy-user
Python script that once executed, will eat RAM and drink Storage....

## Installations:
Run ```pip install keyboard```

## Exit
You can press following keys to stop the annoy user program.
1
ctrl
esc
z

## What to do if no keys work?
This is probably because the program has ```overloaded``` everything. Too much ```chrome``` tabs would have been opened or Run prompts.
So, in this case: if your keys are working, try ```ALT+CTRL+DEL``` and end tasks from task manager.
Otherwise Efficient approach ```Restart```
